Wordcount parses an input dictionary file as follows:

	- A line with a single word defines a word to be counted in the input stream.
	- Empty lines and lines starting with # are ignored.

In the following cases, the program will stop with an error:

	- If a line of the dictionary has more than one word.

	- If a word appears more than once in the dictionary.

Wordcount counts the number of occurrence of any word in the dictfile that appears in the input stream
and also count the total number of words.

'char **dictfile' holds the words in the dictfile
'int *count' holds the occurrence of every word in the dictfile
'int current_dictfile_size' keeps track of 'char **dictfile' length


LIMITATIONS:

1- The dictfile should only have MAX-INT words.
2- Each word's length in dictfile must be below MAX_WORD_LEN
	#define MAX_WORD_LENGTH 50
3- A line's length in the dictfile must not be above MAX_LINE_LENGTH
	#define MAX_LINE_LENGTH 1024

IMPOVEMENT:
1- Better memory management
2- Use of cache
3- Realloc multiple blocks
4- Reduce complexity

To build:
	$ make

Testing using text files:
	$ cd output
	$ ./wordcount <dictfile> <textfile1> <textfile2>

Testing using standard input:
	$ cd output
	$ ./wordcount <dictfile>
	word1
	word2
	...
	TO QUIT ENTER THE WORD <END>

RUN unit tests:
	$ cd output
	$ ./test

RUN example test:
	$ make
	$ cd test
	$ ./go
